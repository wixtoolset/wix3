# WiX v3.x pull requests

Active development has now moved to [WiX v4][wix4].

* **Pull requests for new features are extremely unlikely to be accepted for WiX v3.x.**
* Pull requests for important bug fixes might be accepted.

Pull requests for WiX v3.x must be approved before they can be reviewed or accepted.

* If an [issue][issue] doesn't exist for the problem, create one.
* Provide lots of detail so someone just reading the issue can get a good understanding of the problem.
* If possible, attend the biweekly (fortnightly) online meeting for discussion. Meetings are announced on the [wix-devs mailing list][wixdevs].
