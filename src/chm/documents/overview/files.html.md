# File Types

There are many file types in WiX that are generated from different tools in the toolset. At the highest level, all input files and intermediate files for WiX are XML files. The
final output is in the form of standard Windows Installer database files.

For example, to build an MSI or MSP, the compiler processes the source files
(.wxs and .wxi) and produces object files (.wixobj). These objects files are then consumed by the linker, which produces Windows Installer database files (.msi or .msm). This is analogous to the C++ model of compiling source code to object files, then linking to produce executables.

## List of file types

The following list describes the supported file types in WiX:

## Additional Information

### Structure of .wxs files

All .wxs files are well-formed XML documents that contain a single root element named &lt;Wix/&gt;. The rest of the source file may or may not adhere to the WiX schema before preprocessing. However, after being preprocessed all source files must conform to the WiX schema or they will fail to compile.

The root &lt;Wix&gt; element can contain at most one of the following elements as children: &lt;Product&gt;, &lt;Module&gt;, and &lt;Patch&gt;. However, there can be an unbounded number &lt;Fragment&gt; elements as children of the root &lt;Wix&gt; element. When a source file is compiled into an object file, each instance of these elements creates a new section in the object file. Therefore, these three elements are often referred to as section elements.

It is important to note, that there can be only one &lt;Product&gt; or &lt;Module&gt; or &lt;Patch&gt; section element per source file because they are compiled into special sections called entry sections. Entry sections are used as starting points in the linking process. Sections, entry sections, and the entire linking process are described in greater detail later in this document.

The children of the section elements define the contents of the Windows Installer database. You&rsquo;ll recognize &lt;Property&gt; elements that map to entries in the Property table and a hierarchy of &lt;Directory&gt; elements that build up the Directory table. Most elements contain an &ldquo;Id&rdquo; attribute that will act as the primary key for the resulting row in the Windows Installer database. In most cases, the &ldquo;Id&rdquo; attribute also defines a symbol when the source file is compiled into an object file.

### Symbols and references

Every symbol in an object file is composed of the element name plus the unique identifier from the &ldquo;Id&rdquo; attribute. Symbols are important because they can be referenced by other sections from any source file. For example, a &lt;Directory&gt; structure can be defined in a &lt;Fragment&gt; in one source file and a &lt;Component&gt; can be defined under a different source file&rsquo;s &lt;Fragment&gt;. By making the &lt;DirectoryRef&gt; element a parent of the &lt;Component&gt; an explicit reference is created that references the symbol defined by a &lt;Directory&gt; in the first source file. The linker is then responsible for stitching the symbol and the reference together in a single Windows Installer database. In some cases, implicit references are generated by the compiler while processing a source file. These implicit references behave identically to explicit references.

In addition to the simple references described above, WiX supports specific complex references. Complex references are used in cases where the linker must generate extra information to link the symbol and reference together. The perfect example of a complex reference is in the Windows Installer&rsquo;s Feature/Component relationship. When a &lt;Component&gt; is referenced explicitly by a &lt;Feature&gt; through a &lt;ComponentRef&gt; element, the linker must take the &lt;Feature&gt;&rsquo;s symbol and the &lt;Component&gt;&rsquo;s symbol and add an entry to the FeatureComponents table.

This Feature/Component relationship is even more complex because certain elements in a &lt;Component&gt;, for example &lt;Shortcut&gt;, have references back to the primary Feature associated with the Component. These references from a child element of a &lt;Component&gt; are called reverse references or sometimes feature backlinks. Processing complex references and reverse references is probably the most difficult work the linker has to do.

### Structure of the .wixobj file

A .wixobj file is created by the compiler for each source file compiled. The .wixobj file is an XML document that follows the objects.xsd schema defined in the WiX project. As stated above the .wixobj file contains one or more sections that, in turn, contain symbols and references to other symbols.

While the symbols and references are arguably the most important pieces of data in the .wixobj file, they are rarely the bulk of the information. Instead, most .wixobj files are composed of &lt;table&gt;, &lt;row&gt; and &lt;field&gt; elements that provide the raw data to be placed in the Windows Installer database. In many cases, the linker will not only process the symbols and references but also use and update the raw data from the .wixobj file. It is interesting to note that the object file schema, objects.xsd, uses camel casing where the source file schema, wix.xsd, uses Pascal casing. This was a conscious choice to indicate that the object files are not intended to be edited by the user. In fact, all schemas that define data to be processed only by the WiX tools use camel casing.
