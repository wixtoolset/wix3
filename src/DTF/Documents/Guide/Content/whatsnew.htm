        </ul>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, all these changes do mean that migrating tools and applications from
        the previous release can be a moderate amount of work.</p>
        
        <h3>Breaking Changes</h3>
        <p>For the first time since v1.0, this release contains some major breaking
        changes, due to a significant redesign and cleanup effort that has been a
        long time coming. The overall purpose of the changes is to bring the class
        libraries much closer to ship-quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>All libraries use a new namespace hierarchy
            under <font face="Consolas, Courier New">Microsoft.Deployment</font>.
            The new namespace aligns with the new project name, gives all the various
            libraries an identity that makes them obviously related to the DTF project,
            and mostly avoids "taking over" a namespace that might be rightfully owned
            by the platform technology owner.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Assemblies are also renamed to follow namespaces.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>A new unified compression framework forms the basis for the new ZIP
            library and a redesigned CAB library. Additional archive formats can
            be plugged into the framework. The stream-based compression APIs have
            been redesigned to be more object-oriented and easier to use. The file-based
            APIs are mostly unchanged from the old cabinet library, although some names
            have changed in order to fit into the new unified framework.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Large parts of the WindowsInstaller library have been redesigned
            to be more object-oriented and to better follow .NET Framework design
            guidelines. And various APIs throughout the library have naming or other
            changes for better consistency and to follow conventions and best
            pratices as enforced by FxCop.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The WindowsInstaller APIs no longer make any attempt to mimic the
            MSI COM automation interfaces. The naming and object patterns in the
            automation interfaces often conflicted with with best practices for
            .NET Framework class libraries. Since most people start using DTF
            without having ever experienced MSI scripting, there is little
            reason to match the scripting object model. Making the APIs more
            consistent with .NET conventions will make them much easier to use
            for people already experienced with the .NET Framework.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>APIs in all class libraries use generics where appropriate, especially
            the generic collection interfaces. This means .NET Framework 2.0 or later
            is required.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The FilePatch library is missing from this release. An updated
            and redesigned file-delta library is in development.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Other Changes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>New MakeSfxCA tool for building managed custom action packages: In addition to
            packaging the CA DLL and dependencies, it automatically detects managed CA methods
            and generates corresponding unmanaged DLL entrypoints in the CA host DLL (SfxCA.dll),
            where they are called by MSI. Previously it was necessary to either provide this
            mapping in a CustomAction.config file, or live with the generic "ManagedCustomActionN"
            names when authoring the CustomAction table in the MSI. For more info, see the
            help topic on building managed custom actions.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Out-of-proc managed custom action DLLs:
            When a managed custom action runs, it normally requests a specific major
            version of the CLR via CustomAction.config. However in the previous implementation,
            the request could be ignored if there was already a different version of the CLR
            loaded into the MSI process, either from a previous custom action or by some other
            means. (The CLR doesn't allow side-by-side versions within the same process.)
            While there have been no reports of this issue causing setup failures in practice,
            it may be only a matter of time, as new CLR versions keep coming out.</p>
            
            <p>The redesigned native host for managed custom actions, SfxCA.dll, re-launches
            itself in a separate process before loading the CLR and invoking the managed CA.
            This ensures that the desired CLR version is always loaded, assuming it is available
            on the system. It also sets up a named-pipe remoting channel between the two processes.
            All session-related MSI API calls are routed through that channel, so that the
            custom action has full access to the installer session just as if it were
            running in-process.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The new zip compression library supports nearly all features of the zip
            file format. This includes the ZIP64 extensions for archives greater than 4GB,
            as well as disk-spanning capabilities. Zip encryption is not supported. The zip
            library has been tested against a variety of third-party zip tools; please
            report any issues with incompatible packages.</p>
            
            <p>Currently only the basic DEFLATE compression algorithm is supported
            (via System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream), and the compression level is not adjustable
            when packing an archive. The zip file format has a mechanism for plugging in arbitrary
            compression algorithms, and that capability is exposed: you can provide a Stream object
            capable of compressing and decompressing bytes as an alternative to DeflateStream.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Added support for the few APIs new in MSI 4.0:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><font face="Consolas, Courier New">Installer.GetPatchFileList()</font></li>
                <li><font face="Consolas, Courier New">InstallLogModes.RMFilesInUse</font></li>
                <li><font face="Consolas, Courier New">ComponentAttributes.DisableRegistryReflection</font></li>
                <li><font face="Consolas, Courier New">ControlAttributes.ElevationShield</font></li>
            </ul>&nbsp;<br /></li>

            <li><p>The documentation is now built with the
            <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb608422.aspx" target="_blank">Sandcastle</a> doc build engine,
            with help from the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB" target="_blank">Sandcastle
            Help File Builder</a>. (The old CHM was built with NDoc.)</p></li>

            <li><p>The documentation includes detailed class diagrams for the
            WindowsInstaller and Compression namespaces.</p></li>

            <li><p>WindowsInstaller API doc topics now link straight to the corresponding
            unmanaged MSI API topics in MSDN. If you know an unmanaged MSI API you want to
            use but don't know the managed equivalent, you can search for it and find what
            managed APIs link to it.</p></li>

            <li><p>Unit tests cover about 90% of the Compression, Compression.Zip, and
            Compression.Cab assemblies -- basically everything except some rare
            error-handling cases.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Unit tests along with samples cover over 50% of the WindowsInstaller and
            WindowsInstaller.Package assemblies (including custom action functionality). More
            test cases are still being added.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Bugfixes</h3>
        <p>In addition to the extensive cleanup due to redesigns and unit tests, the following
        reported bugs have been fixed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Managed custom actions could in rare instances fail to load with error 183
          (directory already exists)</p></li>
          <li><p>Timestamps of files in a cabinet could be incorrectly offset based on the timezone.
          (This was due to a behavior change in the DateTime class between .NET 1.1 and 2.0.)</p></li>
          <li><p>Unicode file paths for cabbed files could be handled incorrectly in some cases</p></li>
          <li><p>Installer.DetermineApplicablePatches just didn't work</p></li>
          <li><p>InstallPackage.ApplyPatch couldn't handle applying multiple patches to the same layout</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>LINQ to MSI</h3>
        <p><i>You'll never want to write MSI SQL again!</i></p>
        <p>Language INtegrated Query is a new feature in .NET Framework 3.5 and C# 3.0. Through
        a combination of intuitive language syntax and powerful query operations, LINQ provides
        a whole new level of productivity for working with data in your code. While the .NET
        Framework 3.5 provides LINQ capability for SQL databases and XML data, now you
        can write LINQ queries to fetch and even update data in MSI databases!</p>
        
        <p>Look at the following example:<br />
        
<pre><font face="Consolas, Courier New">    <font color="blue">var</font> actions = <font color="blue">from</font> a <font color="blue">in</font> db.InstallExecuteSequences
                  <font color="blue">join</font> ca <font color="blue">in</font> db.CustomActions <font color="blue">on</font> a.Action <font color="blue">equals</font> ca.Action
                  <font color="blue">where</font> ca.Type == CustomActionTypes.Dll
                  <font color="blue">orderby</font> a.Sequence
                  <font color="blue">select new</font> {
                      Name = a.Action,
                      Target = ca.Target,
                      Sequence = a.Sequence };
          
    <font color="blue">foreach</font> (<font color="blue">var</font> a <font color="blue">in</font> actions)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(a);
    }
    </font></pre>

        The query above gets automatically translated to MSI SQL:</p>
        
        <p><font face="Consolas, Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT `InstallExecuteSequence`.`Action`,
        `CustomAction`.`Target`, `InstallExecuteSequence`.`Sequence` FROM `InstallExecuteSequence`, `CustomAction`
        WHERE `InstallExecuteSequence`.Action` = `CustomAction`.`Action` ORDER BY `InstallExecuteSequence`.`Sequence`</font></p>
        
        <p>But the query is not executed until the <font face="Consolas, Courier New">foreach</font>
        enumeration. Then records are fetched from the results incrementally as the enumeration progresses.
        The objects fetched are actually of an anonymous type created there in the query with exactly
        the desired fields. So the result of this code will be to print the Action, Target, and Sequence
        of all Type 1 custom actions.</p>
        
        <p>The query functionality is currently limited by the capabilities of the MSI SQL engine. For
        example, a query can't use <font face="Consolas, Courier New">where (ca.Type &amp;
        CustomActionTypes.Dll) != 0</font> because the bitwise-and operator is not supported by
        MSI SQL. The preview version of LINQ to MSI will throw an exception for cases like that, but
        the eventual goal is to have it automatically move the data and operation outside of MSI when
        necessary, so that any arbitrary expressions are supported in the query.</p>
        
        <p>Note there are no MSI handles (or <font face="Consolas, Courier New">IDisposable</font>s)
        to worry about! Handles are all managed internally and closed deterministically. Also,
        with the entity object model for common tables, the compiler will tell you if you get a
        column name wrong or misspelled. The entity objects even support easy inserting, updating,
        and deleting (not shown here).</p>
        
        <p>For more examples, see the LinqTest project in the source. More documentation
        is being written.</p>
        
        <p>Obviously, LINQ to MSI requires .NET Framework 3.5. Everything else
        in DTF requires only .NET Framework 2.0.</p>
        
        <p><font color="red">Note: The LINQ functionality in this DTF release is of preview quality only
        and should not be used in production. While there are unit tests covering a wide
        variety of queries, using advanced queries outside what is covered by the tests
        is likely to result in unexpected exceptions, and retrieved data might possibly be
        incorrect or incomplete. An updated LINQ to MSI library is in development.</font></p>
