* BMurri: WIXBUG:5186 - Fix build warning MSB3277:
  * Starting with VSIP 10 SP1 the Assemblies directory was split into two subdirectories: v2.0 & v4.0. That change wasn't properly reflected in the code, rendering many of the various HintPaths ineffective.
  * MSBuild was picking a different version of Microsoft.VisualStudio.CommonIDE than the one most likely intended (and that particular assembly never was in VSIP 2010 SP1).
  * It's possible that the build warning could possibly mask some unexpected behaviors introduced after support for some VS post-2010 was added do to the different version of the assembly selected from the original code's assumption.
