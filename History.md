* BMurri: WIXBUG:5186 - Fix build warning MSB3277:
  * Starting with VSIP 10 SP1 the Assemblies directory was split into two subdirectories: v2.0 & v4.0. That change wasn't properly reflected in the code, rendering many of the various HintPaths ineffective.
  * MSBuild was picking a different version of Microsoft.VisualStudio.CommonIDE than the one most likely intended (and that particular assembly never was in VSIP 2010 SP1).
  * It's possible that the build warning could possibly mask some unexpected behaviors introduced after support for some VS post-2010 was added do to the different version of the assembly selected from the original code's assumption.

* @barnson: Make CBalBaseBootstrapperApplication::PromptCancel usefully overrideable.
  * Make cancellation related members protected rather than private so PromptCancel can be overridden to provide custom cancellation prompt UI.

* BobArnson: Have Burn rewrite ARP DisplayName during modify so changes to WixBundleName are reflected in ARP.

* MikeGC: Add StrAllocConcatFormatted to concatenate a formatted string to an existing string.

* MikeGC: Add simple combo box support to ThmUtil.

  This is useful to save build time during debugging and to diagnose codegen problems in different versions of VS.

* SeanHall: WIXBUG:4857 - Fix DTF custom actions in Win10 Apps and Features.

* jmcooper8654: WIXFEAT:4437 - Modify Wix.CA.targets to add PDB files to CA Package when /p:Configuration=Debug.
